# ✈️ Flight Delay Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting flight delays using real-world flight data. The dataset includes detailed information such as scheduled times, actual delays, airline identifiers, and more.

---

## 📁 Dataset

**Filename**: `flight delay.zip`  
**Contents**:
- CSV files or data files (assumed) containing flight records
- Fields may include: `Flight Date`, `Airline`, `Origin`, `Destination`, `Scheduled Departure`, `Actual Departure`, `Delay (Minutes)`, etc.

> Note: Please unzip the file after downloading from this repository to access the data.

## 📊 Objectives

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify factors contributing to delays
- Build a machine learning model to predict flight delays
- Visualize delay patterns by time, airline, airport, and weather (if applicable)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** for ML models
- (Optional) **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, or **CatBoost** for advanced models
